<p><strong><u>To my Spring</u></strong></p>

<p>Here she is, the well-spring of my life, and i can't imagine spending the four seasons without her. I saved this picture of us in Washington D.C. to remember how easy she makes the flowers look like weeds, and me look like some
ape regression of humanity. We had a fun time arguing over if Pollack is "real" artist or not (i think he's a hack), but i still have to concede that my art doesn't sell as well as his did. Advice, always take ladies
to an art museum with Degas, Renoire, and Van Gogh on display; ladies love Degas, Renoire, and Van Gogh on display. I was particularly impressed by the statues that were hand-carved from marble and stone. Well that's all for now, get
some sleep out there people (it's only a third of your life after all).<p/><br>
                  <p><strong><u>Ready, WRITE!</u></strong></p>

                <p>  I DID IT! I got a contract to work freelance writing character dialogue for a videogame company. This may not be my dream-job; most likely it won't pay (being deferred payment and all). However,
                  I am hopeful that this is a good chance to put my creativity to the test. My hardest challenge is often working along the restrcitons of other people's character designs, but i think i can manage it. I can't discuss much
                  about this project, but i can say that i am writing dialogue for an app-based game that will premiere up to 40 characters, and is possible (if they do well) to produce further DLC content for thier platf-... oops i said too much.
                  Hopeing you all are well, and getting some sleep ( i know i can't). </p><br>
                  <p><strong><u> Alcohol, an impossible infatuation.</u></strong></p>
                  <p>March 8th, 2016</p>
                  <p>After three days of starving in a hospital bed, i am given some real food for a change. This may not be wholly appropriate to share, but the doctor says that what i had was acute pancratisits. Based on the CT, EKG, MRI, and all other scans: I am pancreatic cancer free. Whew, once again
                  sweet lady cancer is brushing her bony hand against me, and i swear I have never been so violated in all my life (i'm gettin' the vapors), but it alwasys happens like this. The last time i had cancer the tumor was removed, but i can't shake that feeling that madame cancer like to hold me a bit too tightly. In anycase, the doctor
                says i can no longer drink another drop of alcohol... unless i want to go to the ICU for  a week and be starved for a week. The prospect of spending my time and money in a hopsital again is as torturous a notion i can cancieve. The upside of sobriety, is that
              when people want to trust you to get stuff done; it gets done. Also, i am no longer spending my time at the bars (which is sad because i used to love stouts, porters, and red wine) adding extra money to my pocket. I have aslo unintentionally discovered the most poeple
            are asking me to drive them home because i can't drink again (or more accurately i refuse to). One doctor did say i could have one drink, but i thought he was crazy anyway, there is nothing on this earth that could make me get sent to the hospital like that again (people with heart surgery spend less time in the hospital than i did).
            Well that rant is it for now, i hope everyone is feeling good, and getting sleep.   </p>
